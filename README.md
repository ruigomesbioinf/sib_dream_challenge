The goal of this challenge is to predict incident heart failure based on clinical and microbiome data, taking into account the time of the event.

-----------
**DATASET**

The FINRISK cohort data is divided in random subsets for training, test and scoring subsets. The FINRISK cohort includes 7,231 adult stool samples (54% participation rate) collected in 2002 and including 15 years follow up (currently available until the end of 2019). 
Challenge Data includes synthetic data based on FINRISK population cohort study (N=7,231). b. Data is divided into three subsets: training and test data provided to solvers in full, and scoring data which is available only to the organizers and is reserved for the scoring of the challenge. The goal of this challenge is to predict incident heart failure based on clinical and microbiome data, taking into account the time of the event. The model accuracy and calibration will be assessed based on Concordance index and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests respectfully.
